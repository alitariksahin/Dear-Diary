# Dear-Diary

This is a website in which users keep a diary and easily access to it from anywhere.<br>
Here is the link: https://dear-diary-ats.onrender.com/ (Since I deployed my site on a free service, it may take up to 30 seconds to load the page at first access)

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
Node.js/Express and mongoDB are used for the server side.<br>
EJS, css and html are used to design the page and make it dynamic.<br>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
Currently, this website is open to everybody for display purposes, but normally it will be private to every user, and whatever they write on their website
will be confidential. <br>
Also I only provided adding property since I want this site to be similar to a daily diary. <br>
